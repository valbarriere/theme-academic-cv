      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Coucou!

Valentin Barriere is an AI profesor in the CS department of the University of Chile, specialized in multimodal machine learning for social interactions studies, with a focus on natural language processing. He also work on multilingual debates analysis, social biases detection, explainable AI, and also multimodal satellite data processing. Before this, he worked for public institutions such as the Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) and the European Commission's Joint Research Center. 

He is director of several projects focused on the use of Machine Learning for social good with public Chilean institutions, and involved as AI advisor of the CopernicusLAC program in Chile with the aim to develop general multi-modal and multi-resolution models for satellite data processing.
