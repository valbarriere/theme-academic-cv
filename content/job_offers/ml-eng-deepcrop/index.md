We are looking for a Machine Learning / Deep Learning research engineer to work on large multi-modal and multi-resolution representation parsing models with satellite data (image sequences).

### What will you do?

* Participate in FONDEF Advanced Technologies project: an ai system for nation-wide agricultural production monitoring based on crowd-sourced and remote-sensing data.
* Develop end-to-end AI solutions.
* Collection of relevant information and design of solutions focused on the optimization of industrial processes.
* Industrial data processing and analysis.
* Development and implementation of advanced predictive models to model subsections of the process.
* Integration and deployment of solutions in production environments.
* Design and build machine learning pipelines focused on optimization and prediction.
* Collaborate on projects within asset-intensive industries such as mining, energy, pulp and paper, among others, applying ML techniques to improve efficiency and productivity.
