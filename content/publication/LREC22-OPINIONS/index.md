abstract: "In this paper, we present the process we used in order to collect new annotations of opinions over the multimodal corpus SEMAINE composed of dyadic interactions. The dataset had already been annotated continuously in two affective dimensions related to the emotions: Valence and Arousal. We annotated the part of SEMAINE called Solid SAL composed of 79 interactions between a user and an operator playing the role of a virtual agent designed to engage a person in a sustained, emotionally colored conversation. We aligned the audio at the word level using the available high-quality manual transcriptions. The annotated dataset contains 5627 speech turns for a total of 73,944 words, corresponding to 6 hours 20 minutes of dyadic interactions. Each interaction has been labeled by three annotators at the speech turn level following a three-step process. This method allows us to obtain a precise annotation regarding the opinion of a speaker. We obtain thus a dataset dense in opinions, with more than 48% of the annotated speech turns containing at least one opinion. We then propose a new baseline for the detection of opinions in interactions improving slightly a state of the art model with RoBERTa embeddings. The obtained results on the database are promising with a F1-score at 0.72."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We've added new opinion annotations to the SEMAINE dataset, which captures dyadic interactions between humans and virtual agents, resulting in a rich dataset with over 73,000 words and 6 hours of conversation. Our annotations and proposed baseline model using RoBERTa embeddings achieve promising results, with a F1-score of 0.72, making it a valuable resource for opinion detection in human-computer interactions.
