  country: Chile

summary: We organized the CENIAMODAL workshop, where I gave a talk on Large Multimodal Models.
abstract: 'We first start by defining quickly what it means to be multimodal, what can be different modalities and what are the challenges. Second, we look at the simple fusion methods and the early large multimodal architectures and tasks. We then review the road from there to the large multimodal models of nowadays, with open-source datasets, models and the ways to evalute these new models.'

#### Multimodal Emotion Recognition

Mohammad Soleymani is a research associate professor with the USC Institute for Creative Technologies. He received his PhD in computer science from the University of Geneva in 2011. From 2012 to 2014, he was a Marie Curie fellow at Imperial College London. Prior to joining ICT, he was a research scientist at the Swiss Center for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva. His main line of research involves machine learning for emotion recognition and behavior understanding. He is a recipient of the Swiss National Science Foundation Ambizione grant and the EU Marie Curie fellowship. He has served on multiple conference organization committees and editorial roles, most notably as associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing (2015-2021), general chair for ICMI 2024 and ACII 2021 and technical program chair for ACM ICMI 2018 and ACII 2017. He was the president of the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) (2019-2021).
