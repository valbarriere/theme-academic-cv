### All the different classes can be found [here](../../deep-index)! 

This is the CC66204 course from the Universidad de Chile. Based on the class of [Ivan Sipiran](https://github.com/ivansipiran), I added details in each of the classes, allowing to understand on how we get to the recent large multimodal models. The github is [here](https://github.com/valbarriere/CC6204-Deep-Learning/).

3. **[TODO] Losses and Activations**: General losses, Softmax, CE, Activation functions
4. **[TODO] Initialization and Optimization**: Weights initialization, Complex gradient descents 
5. **Regularization**: Penalization, Dropout, Data augmentation
6. **[TODO] Convolutional Layer**: Convolution, Padding, Pooling, LeNet
7. **Computer Vision Architectures**: ImageNet, Revolution of depth, Classical classifiers architectures 
8. **Transfer Learning**: Motivation, Principle, Types of TL, Weights unfreezing, Pre-training datasets, SoTA
